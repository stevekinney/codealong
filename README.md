# Code Along

## Raison D'Ãªtre

When I'm teaching a code-along-style lesson at [Turing School][ts], I'll often have students ask if I can go back to some other file. This kind of breaks the flow. This application hopes to accomplish the following:

1. Spin up a server that serves all of the files in the current directory
1. Highlights the syntax based on the file name
1. Pushes updates whenever the file is changed and saved

## Contributing

This is fairly early days. So, I'm not really sure where it's going yet. I'm accepting bug fixes, but not new features or feature requests at this time.
